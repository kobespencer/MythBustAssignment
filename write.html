      MythBusting: How does speaking 2 or more languages affect child
      development?
    </h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Language is the non-physical connection that humans interact with.
        Speaking is an integral part to what it means to be human and a part of
        society. In many ethnic households, children grow up learning two or
        more languages. Immigrant parents foster this kind of environment
        knowingly or unknowingly that it will help their child’s brain develop
        and prosper in the future. A Hungarian psychologist took this idea to
        the next level. Laszlo Polgar was able to raise three chess prodigies by
        following his method of raising geniuses. One requirement he mentioned
        was knowing two languages. The children all knew a widely spoken
        language in Hungary called Esperanto. These three children became chess
        record breakers. This experiment was definitely brought to the extreme
        but it suggested answer to the Nature vs. Nurture aspect of life. Polgar
        showed the world that healthy babies are able to become geniuses when
        given the right resources and parenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Karolina Lukasik et al set out to discover an answer to their
        hypothesis; Bilingual Executive Advantage (BEA). Their research method
        included testing individuals who were bilingual against those who were
        monolingual in working memory tests (Lukasik et al 2018). They had a
        sample size of 485 participants and were given tasks that tested their
        visuospatial working memory, verbal working memory, and n-back (n-back
        tests are tests that continuously test working memory). Some of the
        tests included their ability and frequency of switching between
        languages. The results were shocking and a lack of consistent support
        for the BEA hypothesis. The team ultimately found that the results were
        non-significant and any other tests were irrelevant to the BEA
        hypothesis.Their results were kind of inconclusive because they had
        small results showing that the bilinguals had a very small advantage for
        their working memory but unfortunately, not enough significance (Lukasik
        et al 2018). Their main defeat for the support of the BEA hypothesis was
        that “..our study failed to find consistent support for the BEA
        hypothesis in the domain of working memory. A major difficulty in this
        venue of research is that the original hypothesis does not delineate the
        exact conditions of bilingual experience that are required for BEA to
        emerge.” (Luksaik et al 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
        While the team most likely did their best for their experiment; I find
        that there could be better ways of producing solid results for the BEA
        hypothesis. First, we are going to take a look at the fact that the BEA
        hypothesis could be expanded to not just cognitive function through
        tests, rather, the advantages overall. Advantages of being bilingual
        could come in many shapes and forms. Whether it involves traveling to
        other countries, interacting in the workplace, and or clearing up any
        language barriers, etc. Children and adults who know more than one
        language already seem two steps ahead of their peers who do not. For
        example, someone who is able to speak Chinese Mandarin or Spanish could
        potentially speak with the majority of the world. Secondly, Luksaik et
        al could have conducted their experiment in a different setting. Being
        bilingual in places such as the United States where culture and
        languages from all over the world meet, prove to be of an advantageous
        trait. To improve their experiment, I would add a survey research —this
        was mentioned briefly in their discussion portion of their paper— method
        to participants of different ethnic backgrounds. The survey would
        include how comfortable they are traveling to different countries, if
        the language they spoke has given them any advantage in the workplace,
        and if the language they speak has been a way of networking. This survey
        portion could potentially give insight to any day to day advantage one
        might overlook. Krista Byers-Heinlein and Casey Lew-Williams had similar
        things to say about this; “bilingual children will know multiple
        languages, which is important for travel employment, speaking with
        members of one’s extended family, maintaining a connection to a family
        culture and history..” (Heinlein 2018).

        Finally, the BEA hypothesis is definitely something that will be studied
        and reviewed more often in the near future. Its “advantages” could
        extend and include moments in life where language is overlooked and not
        just some working memory test. Polgar raised geniuses through providing
        an environment that involved language learning and chess playing.
        Lukasik tried to study how knowing a second language might impact one’s
        working memory. Both of these people tried showing to the world what
        advantages being bilingual might have. While Lukasik et al was unable to
        fully prove their support for the BEA hypothesis, there could be more
        studies currently being done to find support and clearly show that
        bilingualism could prove to be an advantage growing up and later in
        life.
